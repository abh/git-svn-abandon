1. git svn clone your repo, preferably using http://github.com/samv/git/tree/svn-merge-attrs
2. inside the repo run svn_fix_refs.sh
3. create .git/info/grafts for merge commits (might not be necessary with the svn-merge-attrs branch)
4. run svn_cleanup.sh

the resulting repository has only refs/heads/* and tags

all svn tags are recreated as annotated tags

git-svn-id and svk message pollution is cleaned up
